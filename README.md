# Basketball_Project
Data Science: Sports project for ISM under Debyan Gupta for my undergraduate

Helps you find the similarity in different basketball teams using K-Means Clustering. If you want to run the code, you only need to download the "Main" file. 
The rest were used for testing purposes or the code will generate the necessary folders as required.
